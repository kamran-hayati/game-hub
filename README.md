## Design a `QoS` / `QoE` Aware Game Hub in a **Multi-Cloud** Environment
- Accomplishing Master Thesis on the Design of a `QoS` / `QoE` Aware `Game-Hub` in a **Multi-Cloud** Environment.
- **Serverless** is amazing for starting quickly to make money. Yet, the entire process doesn't suit all types of projects, especially where the projects are growing fast and data accumulating in a vendor used to provide a service getting a scale of gigabytes per customer. `Vendor Lock-in` is an example against the purpose of using **Serverless** in the first place to reduce the **cost** and put in other ways to run with the trade-off so that **Multi-Cloud** comes in handy as a solution.
- However, **Multi-Cloud** itself has its requirements to be considered more efficient than **Serverless**, applying algorithms to make the right decision to choose a vendor for ingress / outgress data fetching from proper backend service (e.g. either of local files or databases.)
- Game-Hub instinctively unifies game binaries in its data centre employing edge technology load balancing, helping end-users reduce their **costs** of downloading to access binaries, however, cloud gaming, as it's supposed to be, is more responsible rather than delivering binaries. Instead, cloud gaming facilitates most of the rendering, simulating, and encoding to provide streaming game outputs based on the commands that gamers have sent, generated by their gamepads (e.g. any input key by either of consoles, mobiles, PCs, etc.)
- A `game hub` can make a strong connection between game makers and gamers by providing a pipeline from development to production. Employing AI, or more specifically an LLM, helps both game makers and gamers to be satisfied with a proper service powered by the best features presented by **Serverless** and Cloud Gaming, where the `QoS` metric stands on the developer side and `QoE` supports both sides to choose a proper game based on those `awarenesses`.
- In conclusion, the goals referred to by this project `academically` and `industrially` will be applied to the community.
